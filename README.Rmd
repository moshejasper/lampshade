<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of lampshade is to manipulate and visualise short DNA sequences and associated LAMP primers

## Installation

You can install the released version of lampshade from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("lampshade") # doesn't currently exist
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("moshejasper/lampshade")
```
## Example

Here we create a simple DNA container object

```{r example}
library(lampshade)
## basic example code

dna_frame(random_sequence_generator(10))
```
